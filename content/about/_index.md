My full name is Wojciech Anyszka but people call me Wojtek[^1], pronounced as /Voytek/. It's one of diminutive forms of the full name; Wikipedia lists [9 other ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech) and any Polish person could supply you with plenty more. Apparently my name means "he who enjoys war" or "joyous warrior". I hope I'm closer to the second than the first.

I'm a PhD student at Princeton University. I did my MSc in Mathematical Sciences at Oxford and completed three BSc degrees in: Mathematics, Physics and Artificial Intelligence, at University of Groningen in the Netherlands. My current research interest include representation learning, contrastive learning and reinforcement learning. I'm open to collaborations in other areas too. Provided the underyling idea is _cute_ or I find the objective important to achieve and feel I'm able to contribute to it. Maybe I'll expand on my research taste later on. 

When I'm not trying to get another degree (like seriously, when will it end), I like reading, walking, meditating, going to the gym or dabbling in martial arts. Oh! And I'm trying to start writing. Check out my blog :))
